## 👋 About Me

Hi !! I'm Devanand — a curious explorer, builder, and student-innovator on a mission to reimagine how technology works at its core.  
I don’t build things just to function. I build to challenge norms, fill the gaps others overlook, and push ideas way beyond what’s expected.

My work spans from laser-based communication systems to custom PCBs made of glass, from gesture-controlled robots to cryogenic digital boards.  
I’ve always believed that powerful innovation doesn’t come from repeating what already exists — it comes from *asking better questions*.

## 🔍 What I’m Strong At

- **Reimagining systems** from scratch using physics, optics, and microelectronics.
- **Rapid prototyping** of tech with minimal hardware, often combining disciplines like light, sound, and motion.
- **Identifying weak spots** in current tech (e.g., EMI in RF comms, complex robotic wiring, analog delays) — and building smarter, cheaper alternatives.
- **Simplicity-first design** — many of my projects are built using basic, affordable tools, yet solve complex problems cleanly.

## 💥 Why My Ideas Stand Out

Most people improve tech by adding more. I improve it by **stripping it down to essentials** and rebuilding it smarter.


## 🧠 Why I’m Different

I'm not boxed into one domain. I jump across optics, electronics, robotics, and alternative energy — and find **new connections** where others don’t look.

What drives me isn’t competition — it’s curiosity.  
What shapes my ideas isn’t convenience — it’s **clarity of purpose**.

Every project I make is a prototype with a bigger goal:  
To make tech more **efficient**, **accessible**, and **unusual enough to work better than expected**.

## 🎯 My Focus

I don’t believe in distractions — I believe in *disruptions*.  
Every hour I spend building goes toward ideas that can shift how we think about energy, data, machines, and interfaces.

I’m not here to build “cool projects.”  
I’m here to bring  *my imaginations into realities *.
